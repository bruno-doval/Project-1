# Project-1
First Project of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree Program

## Motivation:

We will use the Seattle dataset available in https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data to understand the airbnb maket in that area answering three questions:<br>
<br>
1 - When is the most expensive season to rent a place in Seattle? Are the prices going up in general?<br>
2 - What are the characteristics of the room available in Seattle? <br>
3 - Can we predict the pricing oh the accommodation based on parameters that the user can input before looking at each listing?<br>

## Python packages used:

This project can be executed using the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.x and doesn't need any additional packages.

## Files contained in repository:
Readme.md <br>
project-1.ipynb<br>
calendar.csv - daily data on availability and pricing from kaggle (see link above)<br>
listings.csv - listing characteristics from kaggle (see link above)<br>

## Results

The results are discussed in my medium blog post avaliable in:
